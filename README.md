# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Javascript/JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3.

## Objective of the game:

The goal of the game is to align three of your symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.

## Material :

A game grid of 3x3 squares.

Two players, each represented by a distinct symbol (X or O).

## Game progress:

- The first player places his symbol (X or O) in a square on the grid.

- Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty space.

- The game continues until a player manages to line up three of their symbols consecutively (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), or until the grid is filled without any player reaching the condition of victory.

- If one of the players manages to line up three of their symbols, they win the game.

- If the grid is filled without aligning three symbols, the game is declared void.

## Special rules:

- If the grid is filled without any player having lined up three symbols, the game is declared void.

- It is not possible to place a symbol in a space that is already occupied.
